"back": "## **Matsya Nyaya (Law of the Fish)**\n\n- **The Concept:** In the complete absence of a government, ruler, or law, society rapidly devolves into anarchy and chaos.\n- **The Analogy:** It is compared to the 'Law of the Fish', where the **big fish mercilessly swallow the smaller fish** (meaning the physically strong will endlessly oppress the weak).\n- **The Solution:** A Sovereign State (or King) is absolutely necessary to enforce law, protect the weak, and maintain order (Raja Dharma)."

"back": "## **Washington's Choice**\n\n- **Action:** Following the successful American Revolution, he was immensely popular but **firmly refused** the suggestion to be crowned King.\n- **Reason:** He fundamentally believed in establishing a government run by the people, rigidly bound by a constitution, rather than returning to a monarchy.\n- **Significance:** His refusal set a profound global historical precedent, demonstrating a deep commitment to **republican democratic values** over personal, absolute power."

"question": "In a democracy, why is a Constitution strictly necessary to limit the power of the elected majority?",

It guarantees **Fundamental Rights** (like equality and freedom of speech) that cannot be stripped away or violated, even if the majority votes to do so."

The exposure forced the contractors to immediately rebuild the road to proper standards."
