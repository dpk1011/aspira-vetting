"question": "Why is the 42nd Amendment (passed during the National Emergency) frequently referred to by historians as a 'Mini-Constitution'?",
"back": "## **The 42nd Amendment (1976)**\n\n- **Impact Scale:** It is called a 'Mini-Constitution' because it unilaterally brought massive, sweeping changes to almost every part of the original constitutional document.\n- **Key Alterations:**\n  1. It permanently altered the Preamble by adding the words **'Socialist'** and **'Secular'**.\n  2. It introduced an entirely new section, **Fundamental Duties** (Part IV-A), for citizens.\n- **Context:** It was highly controversial because it was rapidly passed during the period of National Emergency under Indira Gandhi."

"question": "How did the 73rd Constitutional Amendment fundamentally alter the structure of Indian Federalism?",
"back": "## **The 73rd Amendment (1992)**\n\n- **The Integration:** It formally and constitutionally recognized the **Panchayati Raj System** (Rural Local Self-Government).\n- **Structural Impact:** Prior to this, India primarily functioned on a two-tier federal structure (Center and States). This amendment formally established a robust **third tier of federalism**, legally empowering village panchayats with structured elections and decentralized financial authority."

"question": "How did a landmark 2004 Supreme Court ruling fundamentally change how ordinary Indian citizens interact with the National Flag?",
"back": "## **The Flag Code Case (2004)**\n\n- **The Historical Restriction:** For decades, ordinary private citizens were legally restricted from freely flying the National Flag at their homes or offices on non-national holidays.\n- **The Legal Challenge:** A citizen directly challenged this restriction in court, arguing that respectfully hoisting the national flag was a fundamental part of their **Freedom of Speech and Expression** (Article 19).\n- **The Verdict:** The Supreme Court agreed. Today, private citizens possess the fundamental right to fly the Tricolour with pride on any day, provided they strictly maintain its dignity according to the Flag Code."
