This means the air is thinner and physically holds **less oxygen** per breath.\n- **The Effect:** The lack of oxygen causes hypoxia, leading to breathlessness, dizziness, and intense fatigue.\n- **The Solution:** Acclimatisation involves making scheduled pauses during an ascent to allow the human body time to naturally **adjust** to the lower oxygen levels."

Cotton naturally absorbs this sweat and allows for breathable air circulation.\n- **What to Avoid:** Synthetic fabrics (like polyester) trap moisture against the skin and block airflow.\n- **Accessories:** A cap (for sun protection) and a raincoat or umbrella (as 84% humidity heavily implies an incoming monsoon shower)."

"question": "What are the strict procedural rules for physically placing a Rain Gauge to ensure accurate meteorological data?",
"back": "### Rain Gauge Placement Rules\n- **Open Ground:** Must be positioned far away from trees, tall buildings, or walls that could intercept or block the falling rain.\n- **Elevated Platform:** Placing it slightly above the ground crucially prevents muddy water from splashing *up* and into the funnel.\n- **Flat Surface:** The cylinder must not tilt, as an angle would distort the precise millimeter reading.\n- **Avoid Terraces:** Roofs and terraces often create artificial wind turbulence or splashing, negatively affecting accuracy."

Indicates that severe and potentially dangerous weather is expected; authorities should be ready.\n- **Red (Warning):** **Take Action**. Indicates that extreme, destructive weather is already occurring or imminent, requiring immediate protective measures.",

"question": "Before modern meteorology, how did humans traditionally forecast approaching weather changes by observing nature?",
"back": "### Nature's Forecasting Clues\n- **Ants:** Moving their eggs to higher ground reliably indicates an incoming **heavy rain** or flood.\n- **Frogs:** Croaking exceptionally loudly often signals immediate **rain**.\n- **Pine Cones:** The scales close tightly in **humid** pre-rain conditions and open wide in **dry** weather to release seeds.\n- **Birds:** Flying unusually low to the ground suggests incoming severe storms due to dropping air pressure.\n- **Squirrels:** Frantically hoarding and gathering large amounts of nuts traditionally predicts an incoming **Harsh Winter**, as they instinctively prepare for prolonged cold."
