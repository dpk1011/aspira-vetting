"question": "Why are coins made of 'Alloys' instead of pure metals, and what is the composition of a modern Indian coin?",
"back": "## Alloys in Coinage\n\n- **Definition:** An alloy is a structural mixture of two or more metallic elements.\n- **Reasoning:** Pure metals (like 24k gold or pure copper) are often too soft. Mixing them makes coins **harder, highly durable, and resistant to wear**.\n- **Ancient Use:** Early civilizations commonly alloyed silver with copper.\n- **Modern Indian Coins:** Today's coins are made of **Ferritic Stainless Steel**—an alloy composed largely of **Iron** mixed with **Chromium, Silicon, and Carbon**. This prevents rusting and heavily reduces manufacturing costs.",

Its value comes entirely from public trust and state authority.\n- **Legal Tender:** A legally recognized form of fiat money that, by law, cannot be refused by a creditor in settlement of a debt within that jurisdiction.\n- **Example:** The modern paper Indian Rupee note is both fiat money and legal tender.",

By charging a higher interest rate on loans than they pay on deposits, banks generate profit while injecting necessary capital into the economy.",

For example, an ancient pure gold coin worth ₹10,000 on its face contained exactly ₹10,000 worth of gold.\n- **Token Money:** The **face value** is significantly higher than its **intrinsic material value**.\n- **Example:** A modern ₹10 coin is Token Money because the stainless steel alloy used to make it costs far less than ₹10. If melted down, it loses almost all its value.",

Therefore, physical cash loses its effectiveness as a store of value during periods of high inflation.",
