His supreme objective was the welfare of the people, not personal tyranny.\n- **The Rajatarangini Case Study:**\n  - King Chandrapida of Kashmir wished to build a massive temple, but a poor **cobbler's hut** stood directly in the way.\n  - The cobbler boldly refused to vacate his ancestral home.\n  - **The Resolution:** Instead of using brute military force, the King respected the cobbler's rights, personally asked for permission, and paid fair compensation.\n  - **Lesson:** True Rajadharma means the state must respect the fundamental rights of even its poorest citizens."
