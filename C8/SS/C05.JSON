"question": "Why does the Election Commission of India maintain that its Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are technologically immune to remote hacking?",
"back": "- **Standalone Architecture:** Indian EVMs are completely standalone devices. They are intentionally **never connected** to the internet, local Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth networks, making remote cyber hacking physically impossible.\n- **Independent Power:** They run purely on standard, alkaline **batteries**, entirely eliminating the risk of systemic manipulation via external power grid fluctuations.\n- **Hardware Security:** The core microchip used in the EVM is strictly **'One Time Programmable'** (OTP). It is burned with the software code at the time of manufacturing and can never be rewritten or maliciously altered afterward."

It ensured Neha could exercise her right to vote completely **independently**, while strictly preserving the fundamental **secrecy** of her ballot."
