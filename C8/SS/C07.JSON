The optimization, technological enhancement, and efficient allocation of these factors are the true catalysts for sustained national productivity and GDP growth."

This provides the foundational **knowledge base**.\n- **Training:** The engineer is deployed to an active construction site to test actual materials, operate equipment, and learn site safety protocols. This builds the practical **applied skill**.\n- **Conclusion:** Robust human capital requires both; theory without practical application cannot build durable infrastructure."

Examples include heavy machinery, factory buildings, and computers.\n- **Working Capital:** The assets that are entirely consumed or exhausted during a single production cycle. Examples include raw materials (like yarn for a weaver) and the ready cash in hand required for daily operational expenses.",

It is a fixed obligation that must be paid regardless of whether the business makes a profit or a loss.\n- **Dividend:** A proportional share of the company's actual **profits** paid out to **shareholders** (equity investors).

"back": "- **Definition:** Opportunity Cost is the potential value or benefit of the **next best alternative that is given up** when making an economic choice.\n- **The Reality:** Because factors of production (Land, Labour, Capital) are inherently scarce, they cannot be used for everything simultaneously.\n- **Example:** If a farmer chooses to plant wheat on his 1-acre land, the opportunity cost is the profit he *could have made* by planting sugarcane on that exact same plot.
