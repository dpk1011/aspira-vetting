They collected local land revenue to pay their troops and maintain order.\n- **Bandagan:** The Persian term for special slaves purchased explicitly for military and administrative service. Early Sultans like Iltutmish heavily favored relying on these trained, loyal slaves over aristocratic nobles for key provincial posts."

The harsh journey caused massive death, resentment, and chaos. Recognizing the logistical impossibility of controlling the North from Daulatabad, he eventually ordered everyone back."

He minted cheap **copper and brass coins** and declared they would have the exact same legal value as silver and gold coins.\n- **The Failure:** The state failed to establish a monopoly over the minting process. Consequently, citizens began illegally minting fake copper coins at home. \n- **Outcome:** This massive counterfeiting led to hyperinflation, foreign merchants refusing the coins, and total economic chaos, forcing him to withdraw the policy."

The officer (*Jagirdar*) collected agricultural taxes from this designated area equivalent to his salary.\n\n*Crucial Distinction:* Unlike European feudal lords, Jagirdars **did not own the land** they were assigned. They only possessed the temporary right to collect its revenue, and their assignments were frequently transferred to prevent them from building local power bases."

However, there were **not enough profitable lands (Jagirs)** left to assign to them.\n- **The Effect:** To extract their promised salaries from rapidly shrinking, lower-quality lands, Jagirdars began ruthlessly over-taxing and heavily exploiting the peasantry.\n- **The Result:** This unbearable economic oppression triggered massive agrarian revolts (like those of the Jats and Satnamis), crippling the imperial treasury and fatally weakening the empire from within."

"question": "What is the profound historical significance of the year 1707 in the context of the Indian subcontinent?",
"back": "- **The Event:** It marks the death of the last great, orthodox Mughal Emperor, **Aurangzeb**, after a draining 25-year military campaign in the Deccan.\n- **The Consequence:** His death triggered devastating wars of succession and the definitive, rapid **decline of the centralized Mughal Empire**.\n- **The Aftermath:** This immense power vacuum led to the immediate rise of powerful, independent regional states (like the Marathas, Sikhs, Awadh, and the Nizams of Hyderabad). The resulting fragmented political landscape directly paved the way for British colonial expansion in the following century."
