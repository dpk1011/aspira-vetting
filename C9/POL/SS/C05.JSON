Now, any citizen or social group can approach the court on behalf of marginalized others for the protection of broader **public interest** (e.g., rescuing bonded laborers).\n- **Simplified Procedure:** The Supreme Court drastically simplified the legal process, ruling that even a simple postcard or letter addressed to a judge can be officially treated as a PIL petition.",

Because arbitrarily displacing these communities directly destroys their only means of earning a living, it constitutes a gross violation of Article 21 unless adequate state rehabilitation is provided.",
