Devi Lal's party (Lok Dal) and its allies won a massive landslide of **76 out of 90 seats**, reducing Congress to just 5 seats.\n- **The Democratic Outcome:** Respecting the mandate, the sitting Congress Chief Minister immediately resigned, and Devi Lal assumed power.",

"back": "### **Securing the Mandate**\n- **The Polling Booth:** Upon identification, a voter's finger is marked with indelible ink. They then cast their vote in absolute secrecy by pressing a button on the **Electronic Voting Machine (EVM)**.\n- **Verification:** Official polling agents representing various candidates are permitted to sit inside the booth to observe and ensure no bogus voting occurs.\n- **The Counting:** Post-election, sealed EVMs are opened under heavy security on a pre-determined date. Counting agents from all parties are physically present to independently verify the tally before the final winner is declared.",

"back": "### **Constitutional Autonomy**\n- **The Appointment:** The CEC is formally appointed by the **President of India**.\n- **The Independence:** Once appointed, the CEC is **not answerable** to the President, the Prime Minister, or the ruling government regarding their constitutional duties.\n- **Security of Tenure:** To prevent political coercion, it is virtually **impossible** to remove the CEC prematurely, even if the ruling party strongly opposes their decisions. This strict security of tenure closely mirrors the independence granted to the **Judiciary**.",

"question": "What extraordinary administrative power does the Election Commission (EC) temporarily acquire over government officials during the election period?",

"question": "How is the massive financial expenditure required to conduct national elections analytically justified against other state expenses?",
"back": "### **Perspective on Electoral Costs**\n- **The Data:** The government spent approximately **₹3,500 crores** conducting the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, which mathematically breaks down to roughly **₹40 per voter**.\n- **The Comparative Analysis:** While seemingly large, this entire democratic exercise costs about the same as a single nuclear submarine, and significantly less than hosting international sporting events (like the ₹20,000 crore Commonwealth Games).\n- **The Conclusion:** The cost is substantial, but it is an essential and highly justifiable investment to peacefully sustain the world's largest democracy.",

It demonstrates that the **voters' verdict remains structurally supreme**.",
