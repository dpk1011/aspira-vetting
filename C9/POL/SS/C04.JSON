"question": "Who constitutes the Electoral College for the President of India, and why did the framers choose an indirect election?",
"back": "### **The Indirect Mandate**\n- **The Electoral College:** The President is elected strictly by an Electoral College consisting of:\n  1. The elected Members of Parliament (**MPs**).\n  2. The elected Members of the State Legislative Assemblies (**MLAs**).\n- **The Constitutional Logic:** An indirect election ensures the President represents the entire nation federally, but prevents them from claiming a **direct popular mandate**. A direct mandate would create a dangerous rival power center against the Prime Minister."

"question": "How does the fundamental role of the US President differ structurally from the role of the Indian President?",
"back": "### **Separation vs. Fusion of Powers**\n- **The US Presidential System:** The US President is directly elected and acts as both the Head of State *and* the active Head of Government. They personally appoint their secretaries (ministers) and operate completely independent of the legislature (not answerable to Congress).\n- **The Indian Parliamentary System:** The Indian President is indirectly elected and serves solely as a nominal Head of State. The actual executive power lies with the Prime Minister, who leads the legislature and remains strictly answerable to Parliament."

"question": "Under what specific, highly unstable political scenario does the President of India exercise true discretionary power without relying on ministerial advice?",
"back": "### **The Hung Parliament Scenario**\n- **The Trigger:** Discretion activates exclusively when a general election produces a fractured mandate, meaning **no single party** or pre-poll coalition secures a clear majority in the Lok Sabha.\n- **The Discretion:** The President must utilize personal political judgment to invite a leader who, in the President's opinion, has the best chance of mustering majority support.\n- **The Safety Valve:** To prevent arbitrary power, the President mandates the newly appointed PM to formally prove their majority via a floor test in the Lok Sabha within a strictly specified timeframe."

"question": "What happens if the President of India sends a Bill back to Parliament for reconsideration, and what is this power called?",

"question": "How does the Indian Constitution structurally secure and guarantee the 'Independence of the Judiciary'?",
"back": "### **Shielded from Political Pressure**\n- **Definition of Independence:** It means the judiciary is not under the control of the legislature or the executive, allowing judges to act without fear or favor.\n- **Appointment Security:** Judges are appointed with massive input from the judiciary itself, minimizing raw political interference from the ruling party.\n- **Security of Tenure:** Once appointed, a judge cannot be removed by a simple government order. Removal requires a complex, nearly impossible **Impeachment** process via Parliament.\n- **Financial Autonomy:** Judges' salaries are charged directly to the Consolidated Fund and cannot be reduced to their disadvantage."

The political executive (Government) can raise objections, but if the Collegium reiterates the names, the President is bound to appoint them, ensuring judicial primacy in appointments."
