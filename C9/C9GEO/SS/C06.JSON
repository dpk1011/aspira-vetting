"back": "### **Declining Rate, Massive Base**\n- **The Trend:** After steadily increasing from 1951 to 1981, the annual growth rate **started declining** post-1981.\n- **The Reason:** This decline was primarily due to a rapid fall in birth rates (driven by increased awareness and family planning).\n- **The Paradox:** Even though the *percentage rate* of growth fell, the *absolute number* of people added each decade remained enormous because the declining rate was applied to a massive base population."

This causes an artificial spike in the proportion of adult males in cities, while leaving a higher proportion of elderly, women, and children in rural villages."
