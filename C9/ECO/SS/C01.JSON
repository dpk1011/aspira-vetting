Modern farming relies on **HYV seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and electric tubewells**.\n- **Costs:** Traditional methods have low upfront working capital requirements. Modern methods require **high initial capital** for machinery and continuous expenditure on chemicals and electricity.\n- **Ecological Footprint:** Traditional farming is generally sustainable. Modern farming often leads to **rapid groundwater depletion and loss of soil fertility** over time.",

"back": "### **The Cycle of Rural Debt**\n- **Lack of Surplus:** Small farmers produce barely enough for subsistence, leaving no surplus to generate personal savings.\n- **High-Cost Borrowing:** To purchase seasonal working capital (seeds, fertilizers), they must take informal loans from moneylenders or large farmers at **predatory interest rates** (e.g., 24%).\n- **The Trap:** A large portion of their limited future harvest is immediately lost to debt repayment, ensuring they **remain destitute and must borrow again** the following season.",
