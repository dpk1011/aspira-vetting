Since domestic household chores lack a market valuation and involve no formal monetary exchange, they are classified as non-market activities and are entirely excluded from GNP statistics."

Human capital generally *appreciates* with continuous education and experience, only depreciating through aging or prolonged unemployment."

It is the physical and mental capacity of a person to realize their full potential and fight illness.\n- **Productivity Link:** An unhealthy individual cannot maximize their physical or cognitive output, forcing them to become a liability to an organization or the state. Therefore, health is an indispensable baseline requirement for any subsequent skill or educational investments to yield economic returns."
