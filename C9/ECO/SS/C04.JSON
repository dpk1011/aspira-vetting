This shifted the macroeconomic focus from mere grain availability to actual household accessibility."

It is primarily caused by **extreme poverty** and the resulting inability to afford basic food continuously .\n- **Seasonal Hunger:** Directly related to cycles of **food growing and harvesting**. It is common in rural areas due to the seasonal nature of agriculture, and in urban settings due to seasonal casual labour (e.g., construction halting during monsoons)."

If this economic shock extends over a long period or wide area, it escalates into starvation."

Consequently, without a safety net, he faces extreme difficulty buying basic food for his family during this lean period."
