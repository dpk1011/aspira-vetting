"back": "### **Beyond Monetary Deprivation**\n- **Basic Needs:** Experiencing hunger, malnutrition, and a fundamental lack of shelter .\n- **Health and Sanitation:** Lacking access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation. It also involves a lack of access to healthcare, meaning sick individuals cannot afford basic treatment .\n- **Social Deprivation:** Enduring a pervasive sense of helplessness and social disempowerment, which frequently leads to ill-treatment at farms, factories, and offices.",

"question": "What is the fundamental difference between 'Absolute Poverty' and 'Relative Poverty'?",
"back": "### **Comparing Poverty Metrics**\n- **Absolute Poverty:** A severe condition where a person's income falls below a strictly defined minimum threshold (the poverty line) required to meet basic life necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. It is a fixed, absolute measure of deprivation.\n- **Relative Poverty:** A condition where individuals lack the minimum amount of income needed to maintain the average standard of living in the society in which they live. It is a comparative measure that evaluates economic inequality within a nation rather than sheer physical survival.",

"question": "How does the broader concept of 'Human Poverty' expand upon the strict official, income-based definition of poverty?",
