Their primary duty was the physical **protection** of the tribe and the organization of highly strategic **cattle raids** against rival groups.",

Raiding the herds of rival tribes was the primary mechanism to acquire wealth and expand economic power.\n- **Social Status:** Raiding was deeply tied to prestige. Young men proved their bravery and **manliness** by successfully executing raids and fiercely defending their own herds, which legitimized their status as Warriors within the community.",

They were strictly prohibited from migrating outside these boundaries.\n- **The Result:** Trapped within a dry zone without the ability to seek fresh pasture, droughts became lethal. For instance, during the severe drought of 1933-34, over **half the cattle** in the Maasai Reserve died from starvation.",

Instead, they appointed specific individuals as **Chiefs** over various Maasai sub-groups to administer affairs on behalf of the colonial state.\n- **The Restrictions:** To cement their control, the British imposed strict legal bans on all traditional **cattle raiding** and tribal warfare.\n- **The Impact:** This aggressive restructuring severely undermined the traditional authority, prestige, and political power of both the ruling **Elders** and the protective **Warriors**.",

They had a regular monetary income (salary), bought land, invested in trade, and often lived in towns. Because they had diverse income streams, they easily **survived devastating droughts**.\n- **Poor Pastoralists:** They depended entirely on their livestock. In bad years (during drought or war), they lost everything. Forced into destitution, they had to migrate to towns to seek meager work as **charcoal burners**, construction workers, or day laborers.",
