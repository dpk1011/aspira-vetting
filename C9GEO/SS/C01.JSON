The equator receives relatively direct sunlight year-round, resulting in days and nights being nearly equal (approx. 12 hours each) regardless of the season.\n- **Kashmir (High Latitude):** It is located far from the equator.

Therefore, a 30° difference results in a 120-minute (2-hour) difference (30 x 4 = 120).\n- **Consequence:** The sun rises two hours earlier in Arunachal Pradesh than in Gujarat.",
