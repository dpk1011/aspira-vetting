Tenzing's father actively participates in domestic chores (cooking and cleaning), while the mother is a significant economic contributor working in a handicraft cooperative.\n- **Democratic Decision-Making:** Important financial choices and special expenses are not dictated by one person but are openly discussed by the parents together, highlighting **consultation and equal partnership** in family governance.\n- **Diversified Economy:** The family demonstrates economic resilience by relying on a mix of income streams, including a small family business (grocery store) and cooperative handicraft work."

"back": "### Beyond Mere Proximity\n- **Shared Connection:** A community is a distinct group of connected people (comprising individuals and multiple families) who live in the same area or work toward a shared purpose.\n- **Active Interdependence:** Unlike a crowd, a community is defined by mutual reliance. Members actively share resources, organize collective governance, and support each other through daily life, festivals, harvests, and crises.\n- **Flexible Scope:** The concept is highly adaptable; a community can refer to a geographical village, a social *jāti* (caste), a religious congregation, or even a specialized professional or school club."

They naturally organize around various shared identities, including geographic region, shared religious beliefs, common occupational work, or traditional kinship networks like *jāti*."

Elected members create and enforce rules regarding shared neighborhood concerns, such as **waste management**, maintenance of parks, cleanliness, and security.\n- **Sociological Significance:** They represent a highly structured form of **urban community participation**, demonstrating how people in dense cities artificially organize to collectively manage their immediate living environment."

Every individual and family has specific functional duties and obligations they must perform to keep the community thriving.\n- **The Balance:** There is an inherent social contract: secure access to the community's resources and protections (**Rights**) comes with an inseparable obligation to follow the established rules and contribute actively to the collective well-being (**Duties**).",
