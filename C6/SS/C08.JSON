The entire country utilizes the same staple grains (Rice, Wheat, Millets, Dal) and core spices (Turmeric, Cumin, Mustard, Ginger).\n- **The Diversity (Dishes):** The diversity arises in the *application*.

It varies drastically in **fabric** (Cotton, Silk, Synthetics), **regional weave patterns** (Banarasi, Kanjivaram), and crucially, in **draping style**, with hundreds of distinct, climate-adapted regional variations (e.g., the Nauvari of Maharashtra vs. the Nivi style of Andhra).\n- **Versatility:** Furthermore, it showcases functional diversity, often being repurposed as a makeshift cradle, a head cover, or even a fishing net.",

This proves that this specific form of attire has been a continuous, unifying element of Indian material culture for well over 2,000 years."
