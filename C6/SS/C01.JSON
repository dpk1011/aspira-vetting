Since every meridian has a different noon time, neighboring cities on different longitudes would have slightly different clocks .\n* **The Issue:** This would cause severe confusion for national infrastructure like railways, flights, and mass communication across a country .\n* **The Solution:** Countries legally select a central **Standard Meridian** and universally apply its local time to the entire nation (Standard Time)."
