"question": "What two distinct categories of names did ancient Chinese texts use for India, and what did they signify?",
"back": "### **1. Phonetic Adaptations (Yintu / Yindu)**\nJust like the Persians and Greeks, the Chinese phonetically adapted the original Sanskrit word 'Sindhu' to fit their language structure (evolving from Sindhu -> Hindu -> **Yindu**).\n\n### **2. Cultural Titles (Tianzhu)**\nThey also prominently referred to India as **Tianzhu**, which translates to **'Heavenly Master'**. This unique, non-geographical title reflected the deep spiritual reverence the ancient Chinese held for India as the sacred homeland of the Buddha.",
"mnemonic": "Tianzhu = Teacher (Heavenly Master/Buddha)."
