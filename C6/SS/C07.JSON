They moved away from external sacrificial rituals to internal inquiry, asking **big questions** about the origins of the universe, life, and the nature of death.\n- **Core Concepts Introduced:** They formalized foundational Indian philosophies, including **Karma** (action), **Rebirth** (Samsara), and the ultimate relationship between the individual **Self (Atman)** and the universal reality **(Brahman)**.",

Instead, he asks to know the ultimate **nature of the soul** and what truly happens after death.\n- **The Moral Lesson:** This story perfectly encapsulates the Upanishadic **spirit of inquiry**.

"back": "### The Power of a Single Truth\n- **The Plot:** Rohineya was a notorious, professional thief who accidentally overheard a small fragment of a sermon delivered by Lord **Mahavira** regarding the nature of celestial beings. \n- **The Test:** Later, when captured by the king's guards, the guards tried to trick him using a fake celestial illusion. Rohineya remembered Mahavira's exact words, saw through the deception, and saved his life. Moved by the power of truth, he confessed his crimes and ordained as a Jain monk.\n- **The Moral:** The story teaches that even a single drop of genuine **spiritual wisdom** has the power to permanently transform a life, and that every individual, regardless of their past, is capable of redemption and deserves a **second chance**.",

"back": "### A Tripartite Approach to Non-Violence\nIn ancient Indian thought, **Ahimsa** is not just a physical restriction; it is a profound ethical commitment demanding total non-violence across three distinct spheres of human existence:\n1. **Action (Deed):** Strictly avoiding causing physical harm, pain, or death to any living organism.\n2. **Speech (Word):** Actively refraining from using harsh, abusive, deceitful, or emotionally hurtful language.\n3. **Thought (Mind):** Eradicating internal violence by not harbouring ill feelings, hatred, jealousy, or malicious intent toward others.\n\n*Note:* While prominent in all Indian thought, Ahimsa represents the absolute highest, foundational vow in Jainism.",

It allowed them to live together collectively, meditate without distraction, study the teachings, and rely on alms.\n- **Historical Significance:** By creating the Sangha, figures like the Buddha and Mahavira successfully institutionalized spiritual seeking. This organized community structure was the primary vehicle responsible for preserving and spreading their philosophies across Asia over the ensuing centuries.",
