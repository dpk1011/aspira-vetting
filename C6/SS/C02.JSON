[cite: 130]\n* **Wave Formation:** These explosive events displace massive volumes of water upward, which creates giant, rolling sea waves. [cite: 131]\n* **Rapid Propagation:** Out in the deep ocean, these waves can travel for thousands of kilometers at incredibly high speeds without being easily noticed. [cite: 132]\n* **Coastal Impact:** The true danger begins when the fast-moving waves reach shallow coastal areas. The friction slows the wave down, forcing the water to rise violently in height, causing massive flooding and structural destruction on land. [cite: 133, 134]"

[cite: 135]\n* **Global Scale:** The resulting tsunami waves killed over 200,000 people across 14 different countries. [cite: 136]\n* **Impact on India:** It severely affected coastal regions like Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It utterly devastated the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, completely submerging Indira Point (India's southernmost tip). [cite: 136, 137]\n* **The Outcome:** The massive loss of life led to the immediate establishment of international Early Warning Systems and the creation of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in India to better handle future crises.
